//! `loom knowledge eval` — score retrieval against a checked-in ground-truth
//! set using hit rate, ranking quality, delivery eligibility, and rendered cost.
//!
//! See `doc/PROPOSAL-retrieval-precision.md` §5 ("Measure it") and Appendix
//! A.20 for the design this module implements. The cases file
//! (`loom/eval/retrieval-cases.yaml` by default) pairs a query with relevant,
//! required, forbidden, or deliberately abstaining outcomes.
//!
//! `mode: stage` differs from `mode: prompt` in its default budget (3000 vs
//! 1500 tokens), in that `stage_fields` lines are newline-joined onto `query`
//! — the same shape `build_stage_query_text` assembles a real stage's
//! metadata into, just supplied by the case instead of a `Stage` record —
//! and in which pack `precision_at_5`/`relevant_token_fraction` judge:
//! `mode: stage` scores them over the raw retrieved pack, since an autonomous
//! stage spawn sees the best available retrieval regardless of the hook's
//! emit floor; `mode: prompt` scores them over the pack the hook would
//! actually hand a fresh session (0.0 when it would abstain), since that is
//! what a prompt-triggered brief actually delivers. hit@5, mrr, forbid
//! checks, mandatory recall, and rendered-token cost are always judged over
//! the raw pack — see `eval::metrics::score_case`.
//!
//! **This is a CLI gate, not a `cargo test`.** It reads the live on-disk
//! index (whatever `loom knowledge sync` last built), which is not
//! reproducible in CI. The unit tests exercise parsing, metrics, and gates
//! with synthetic packs; run this command by hand against a real index.
