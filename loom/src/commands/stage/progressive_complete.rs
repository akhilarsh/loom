///
/// # Concurrency (A-5)
///
/// The in-memory `stage` handed to `complete_with_merge` was loaded before the
/// (potentially multi-minute) acceptance and verification phases ran, so it is
/// stale relative to concurrent daemon/dispute writes. The git merge itself runs
/// *outside* the stages-dir lock (it holds the separate `MergeLock` and can take
/// time), then the merge-completion fields are re-applied to the **fresh**
/// on-disk stage via `update_stage`. The completion operation owns exactly:
/// `completed_commit`, `merged`, `merge_conflict`, and the status transition; it
/// re-applies only those, so a concurrent writer's unrelated fields
/// (`dispute_count`, `retry_count`, amended `acceptance`, …) survive. The
/// in-memory `stage` is also updated so the caller can drive resolver spawning.
///
/// # Returns
/// - `MergeOutcome::Success` if merge succeeded (stage should be marked Completed)
/// - `MergeOutcome::Conflict` if merge conflict (stage already marked MergeConflict)
/// - `MergeOutcome::Blocked` if merge failed (stage already marked MergeBlocked)
/// - `MergeOutcome::Held` if `gate` is `Enforce` and the branch touches a control
///   path (stage already routed to NeedsHumanReview)
/// - `MergeOutcome::NoCommits` if `gate` is `Enforce` and the branch has no commit
///   beyond the merge point (stage already routed to NeedsHumanReview)
///
/// `merged` is set only after `verify_or_derive_completed_commit` proves the
/// stage's commit is in the merge point; a refusal returns `Err` and leaves the
/// stage unmerged.
