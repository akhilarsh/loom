//! `loom stage contracts freeze`: prove every contract test fails before any
//! implementation exists, then ask the daemon to freeze the contract files
//! (DESIGN D8). The rules are two pure functions, [`check_changes`] and
//! [`judge_run`]; [`freeze`] gathers their real inputs. In a relayed session
//! it also keeps each attempt's outcome for the Stop hook
//! ([`crate::verify::contracts::refusal`]).
