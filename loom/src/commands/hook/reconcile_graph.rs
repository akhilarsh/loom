//! `loom hook reconcile-graph` — the A.12/A.22 debounced background self-heal.
//!
//! The prompt hook's own latency budget (a few seconds, well inside the shell
//! wrapper's 5s ceiling) must never pay for rebuilding a source graph, but a
//! stale or [`ContextPack::degraded`] pack (A.11) still deserves fixing —
//! just not on the request that noticed it. [`spawn_if_needed`] launches this
//! module's own subcommand, [`reconcile_graph`], detached and unawaited, so
//! the *next* retrieval benefits instead. See
//! `doc/PROPOSAL-retrieval-precision.md` §A.12/§A.22 and §P3 recommendation
//! 12 for the design.
//!
//! ## Lease and backoff
//!
//! See the `lock` submodule for the `reconcile.lock` line's encoding and the
//! full Spawn/Skip policy table. In short: the lock is a lease. A hook that
//! decides to spawn claims it, the reconciler re-stamps it with its own pid and
//! keeps that pid through every pass, and a request that arrives while it runs
//! only sets `pending`, which earns exactly one more pass. A run that does not
//! end `Current` counts a failure, and each failure doubles the throttle on
//! the next attempt. `loom hook reconcile-graph --cancel` stops the holder.
//!
//! ## Scope resolution
//!
//! `HookTarget` is shared with the prompt and pre-compact delegates, so the
//! reader and background writer cannot derive different overlay addresses.
//! [`ensure_snapshot`] owns both the stage-overlay and local-current rebuild
//! policies; this module only selects the policy carried by that target.
