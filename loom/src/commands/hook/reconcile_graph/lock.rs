//! The `reconcile.lock` lease [`super::reconcile_graph`] and
//! [`super::spawn_if_needed`] share, in the context cache directory
//! (`crate::context::store::CACHE_RELATIVE_DIR`).
//!
//! ## Encoding
//!
//! One line, `"<epoch_secs> <pid> <failures> <pending>"`. `pid != 0` means an
//! attempt STARTED at that epoch and is (as far as the lock says) still
//! running; `pid == 0` means an attempt FINISHED at that epoch. `0` is a safe
//! sentinel: never a real user process's pid on Linux or macOS. `failures` is
//! the count of consecutive failed runs (a success resets it) and drives the
//! backoff; `pending` is `1` when a request arrived while a live holder was
//! running, the bounded queue of one.
//!
//! A line that does not parse as exactly those four fields is treated as no
//! lock, which fails toward SPAWNING rather than toward permanent silence:
//! losing one debounce interval to a corrupt lock is merely annoying, treating
//! it as "someone is on it, forever" is a self-healing feature that stopped
//! healing.
//!
//! ## Writes
//!
//! Every write is a read-modify-write under the cache directory's exclusive
//! lock ([`update_lock`]) and lands through an atomic temp-file rename, so a
//! reader never sees the file missing, empty or half written, and no update is
//! lost: each write carries `failures` and `pending` forward from the line it
//! read. Nothing here ever unlinks the lock.
//!
//! ## Policy
//!
//! [`decide`] is the whole spawn policy, factored out from any process spawn
//! or lock write so it is testable without a real process:
//!
//! | Lock state                                          | Decision | Why |
//! | --------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --- |
//! | none, or unparseable                                | Spawn    | nothing to respect |
//! | `pid != 0`, alive, younger than `stale_lock_secs`   | Skip     | a run is genuinely in progress |
//! | `pid != 0`, alive, `stale_lock_secs` or older       | Spawn    | paranoia ceiling, independent of liveness |
//! | `pid != 0`, dead, any age                           | Spawn    | crashed; must not block healing for the ceiling's duration |
//! | `pid == 0`, younger than [`backoff_secs`]           | Skip     | throttled, doubling per failed run |
//! | `pid == 0`, [`backoff_secs`] or older               | Spawn    | throttle window elapsed |
