//! The source graph of a worktree as it stands on disk, built in memory.
//!
//! Verification judges the tree a stage leaves behind, which no published
//! layer describes: a base layer is a committed revision, and a stage sandbox
//! cannot write the shared cache or an overlay. [`build_for_worktree`]
//! therefore reads the published base layer nearest to `HEAD` among its
//! ancestors, re-extracts every file that differs from it, and resolves the
//! result. Nothing is written: no `ensure_snapshot`, `publish_base` or
//! `save_overlay`, and only git commands that never refresh the index.
//!
//! Without a usable base layer it extracts every source file under the
//! working directory instead and says so in [`WorktreeGraph::degraded`].
