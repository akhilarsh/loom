//! The shared tree-sitter walk every language extractor runs.
//!
//! A language module supplies a [`QueryHarness`] — a grammar, a query, and a
//! capture-name-to-kind mapping — and this module does the rest. Centralizing
//! the walk is what makes the evidence rules *structural* rather than a
//! convention every language implementation has to remember:
//!
//! - a definition nested inside another definition gets the outer one's scope,
//!   plus any qualifier written on the definition itself;
//! - `Contains` edges are [`EdgeProvenance::Structural`], the only class that
//!   carries `1.0`, because containment is syntactic and local;
//! - a `self`/`this` call bound to exactly one member of the enclosing type is
//!   an [`EdgeProvenance::Receiver`] edge;
//! - a plain or qualified spelling with exactly one definition in lexical
//!   scope in this file is an [`EdgeProvenance::LocalName`] edge;
//! - anything else — every import, a call on any other receiver, a name an
//!   import binds, an ambiguous or unknown spelling — is an
//!   [`EdgeProvenance::Syntax`] edge to [`UNRESOLVED_TARGET`], keeping as
//!   `candidates` the ids an ambiguous spelling could mean. Cross-file
//!   resolution decides those.
//!
//! Every `Calls`, `Imports` and `References` edge carries the span of each
//! site it stands for; equal edges merge their sites. Declarations that share
//! an id get signature-derived suffixes (`ids`).
//!
//! ## Capture protocol
//!
//! | Capture                 | Meaning                                            |
//! | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
//! | `@definition.<kind>`    | the whole definition, `<kind>` per [`QueryHarness::kind_for_capture`] |
//! | `@name`                 | the identifier naming the definition in that match |
//! | `@definition.qualifier` | in a definition match: a qualifier written on the definition (`W` in C++ `void W::run()`), inserted into its scope before its name |
//! | `@import.path`          | the module path of an import statement             |
//! | `@import.statement`     | the whole import statement; with the path it goes to [`QueryHarness::import_bindings`] |
//! | `@call.name`            | the callee at a call site, bare or qualified       |
//! | `@call.receiver`        | in a `@call.name` match: the receiver of a member call |
//! | `@reference.name`       | a non-call use that becomes a `References` edge    |
//!
//! A `@definition.*` match with no `@name` is counted toward
//! [`FileCoverage::Partial`] rather than emitted as an anonymous node.
//!
