//! Per-language source extraction: bytes in, [`FileExtraction`] out.
//!
//! Each supported language implements [`SourceGraphExtractor`] over a pinned
//! tree-sitter grammar and a tree-sitter query embedded in that language's
//! module. The registry in this module is the only thing the rest of loom sees;
//! callers never name a grammar directly.
//!
//! ## What extraction promises, and what it does not
//!
//! An extractor promises that every node it emits corresponds to a real
//! declaration in the bytes it was handed, and that every edge it emits carries
//! honest [`crate::context::source_graph::EdgeProvenance`]. It does **not**
//! promise a complete call graph: extraction is per-file, so a call to a symbol
//! defined in another file is emitted as an unresolved syntax edge, never as
//! a bound edge. Cross-file resolution is `crate::context::resolve`'s
//! job, and it too only ever raises confidence with evidence.
//!
//! ## Degraded modes
//!
//! Nothing makes a file vanish from the graph:
//!
//! | Situation                              | Result                                      |
//! | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
//! | No dialect claims the extension        | file node, `FileCoverage::LexicalOnly`      |
//! | Dialect known, grammar not registered  | file node, `FileCoverage::LexicalOnly` (a named gap) |
//! | File over [`MAX_EXTRACTED_FILE_BYTES`] | file node, `FileCoverage::Oversized`        |
//! | Grammar reports a syntax error         | file node, `FileCoverage::ParseError`       |
//! | `source-graph` cargo feature disabled  | file node, `FileCoverage::LexicalOnly`      |
