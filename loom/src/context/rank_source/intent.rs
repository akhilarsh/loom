//! What shape of question a query asks, read from its wording alone.
//!
//! The source ranker's candidacy rule admits a node only when the prompt named
//! it the way code is named (see `candidacy`). Three phrasings carry that
//! evidence in their grammar instead of their spelling, and [`classify`]
//! recognises them so the ranker's `routing` step can act on them:
//!
//! - a quoted phrase is text the graph never indexed, so the answer is a text
//!   search rather than a node;
//! - `who calls X` asks for X's neighbours, not for nodes that resemble X;
//! - `what does X do`, as the WHOLE query, says `X` is a symbol even when it is
//!   spelled like an English word.
//!
//! The patterns are evaluated in that order, and anything else is
//! [`QueryIntent::General`], which leaves ranking exactly as it was.
