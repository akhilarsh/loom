//! Persistence of resolved views.
//!
//! A base view lives at `<cache>/graph/view/<revision>-<identity digest>.json`,
//! shared by every worktree; a stage or local overlay view at
//! `<work>/context/<plan>/<stage>/view.json`. [`GraphStore::view`] serves a
//! view only when its identity equals the one requested: a file that fails to
//! parse or names another identity is rebuilt and rewritten, never served.
//!
//! A view is written only on a miss, so a warm `loom map` runs no resolution:
//! it parses one view file, and the base layer (with the overlay layer, when
//! there is one) that `ensure_snapshot` reads to check the layers are current.
//! A denied write keeps the view in memory for the rest of the process, as
//! layers do. A revision whose base layer does not load, missing or
//! unparseable, gets a view built in memory and never persisted, so the base
//! published or rebuilt later cannot be shadowed by an empty view. So does a
//! graph holding an entry an extractor other than the registered one stamped,
//! or drawn from a layer written under another graph schema: its identity
//! would claim the current extractors and schema.
