//! Types for the derived source graph.
//!
//! The source-graph extractors populate these, and `crate::commands::map`
//! consumes them (via `crate::context::graph_store`) to render `loom map`.
//! The retrieval pipeline reads them too, through
//! `crate::context::rank_source`, so `Channel::Source` candidates are ranked
//! over the same nodes `loom map` renders. They live here rather than in
//! [`crate::context::schema`] because the graph is a distinct domain from the
//! knowledge corpus.
//!
//! [`crate::context::schema`] re-exports the public names, so callers may reach
//! them through either path.
//!
//! ## The honesty contract
//!
//! **This graph is never claimed to be complete.** Every [`SourceEdge`] carries
//! an [`EdgeProvenance`] and an explicit confidence, and a call whose target
//! cannot be resolved is emitted as a `Syntax` edge to [`UNRESOLVED_TARGET`] —
//! never as a bound edge. Only containment is certain. Consumers that render or
//! traverse the graph must surface that confidence rather than flattening it
//! away.
