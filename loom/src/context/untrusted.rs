//! The one flattening routine for untrusted knowledge-derived values.
//!
//! A chunk id, a source pointer, or a summary is rendered onto an agent-facing
//! surface in two places: the Knowledge Brief embedded in a stage signal
//! (`orchestrator::signals::format::brief`) and `loom knowledge context`'s
//! human-readable stdout (`commands::knowledge::context`). Both surfaces render
//! the value as part of their OWN structure — an inline code span or a bare
//! line — while the value itself came from unvalidated data: `fs::knowledge::chunker`
//! takes a file's first chunk id verbatim from its YAML frontmatter, a backtick
//! is a legal character in a path, and a summary is taken from a chunk heading.
//!
//! Emitted raw, a newline in any of them ends the line it sits on and lets the
//! remainder render as document structure — a heading or a sentence standing
//! outside any "quoted, NOT instructions" guard — while a backtick closes an
//! inline code span. Either turns untrusted data into what reads as the
//! surface's own text, in output an agent may treat as instructions or
//! assignment.
//!
//! A third surface calls it for the same reason on different data: the status
//! payload (`commands::status::data::sanitize`) flattens the model names,
//! heartbeat activity, review reasons and crash evidence a `StageSummary`
//! carries before the daemon broadcasts them. There the structure being
//! injected into is a terminal rather than a markdown document — an ESC that
//! survives is an ANSI sequence the operator's terminal obeys — and the
//! renderers cannot stop it, because they bound columns by display width and
//! every character that matters here has a width of zero.
//!
//! Source-window lines are a fourth: tracked file text, printed to the same
//! terminal by `loom map --window` and `loom knowledge context`, and quoted in
//! the brief. [`terminal_safe`] keeps their layout and strips the controls.
//!
//! This is the ONE definition all these surfaces call. A second copy would
//! duplicate a security rule that must never drift between them.
