//! Plan-version-2 doctrine pins (DESIGN D16), split out of `tests_doctrine.rs`
//! to keep that file under the line-count ceiling.
//!
//! - BLOCK-E (the review order): the review section a v2 stage's signal renders
//!   (`v2_section_review.rs`) and `skills/loom-orchestration/SKILL.md`.
//! - Every test-runner adapter is named in the language skill its language
//!   routes to, so a contract author reading that skill finds the adapter.
//! - The plan-writer skill routes v2 authors to `loom project detect` and the
//!   contracts reference.
//!
//! - BLOCK-F (when the stage cannot finish): the standard, integration-verify
//!   and knowledge-distill stable prefixes and `skills/loom-orchestration/SKILL.md`.
//!
//! BLOCK-E is defined here rather than in `tests_doctrine_blocks.rs`, as BLOCK-C
//! is in `tests_doctrine_waiting.rs`: that file is a private child of
//! `tests_doctrine`, so a sibling module cannot reach its constants.
