//! Adjudication subsystem.
//!
//! Disputes filed by agents land in `.loom/work/disputes/<stage>/<n>/request.md`.
//! The orchestrator polls these files every tick:
//!
//! * [`AdjudicatorRegistry::disputes_awaiting_session`] returns the disputes
//!   that need an adjudication session started, having applied every guard
//!   (a verdict already written, a stage that has left `NeedsAdjudication`,
//!   the evidence-round cap, a session already live for the stage, the
//!   spawn-attempt cap), plus an [`Escalation`] for every stage a guard hands
//!   to a human. The daemon spawns the sessions, and retires each escalated
//!   stage's disputing agent before writing its escalation, which closes the
//!   stage's open disputes (`closed_disputes.rs`); see
//!   `orchestrator/core/orchestrator.rs`.
//! * [`AdjudicatorRegistry::apply_pending_verdicts`] scans for verdict
//!   files that haven't been applied (no `applied.marker`) and mutates
//!   stage state accordingly (see `apply.rs`, and `apply_kinds.rs` for the
//!   routing by dispute kind).
//!
//! The adjudicator is a real loom session, not a subprocess the daemon waits
//! on: it is spawned into a terminal inside the disputed stage's worktree when
//! that worktree still exists (the main repository otherwise), judges the
//! dispute with the full tool surface, and hands its verdict over by running
//! `loom stage adjudicate` (see [`record`]). The daemon never blocks on it — it
//! observes `verdict.md` appearing on a later tick, exactly as merge
//! resolution observes `loom stage merge --resolved`.
//!
//! The registry therefore holds no state at all: liveness comes from the
//! session record and the spawn budget from the dispute directory, so a
//! daemon restart mid-adjudication neither loses a running session nor
//! resets its budget.
