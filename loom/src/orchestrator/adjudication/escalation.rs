//! Handing a disputed stage to a human.
//!
//! The dispute loop decides THAT a dispute cannot be taken further; the
//! orchestrator decides WHEN the escalation is written. Filing a dispute does
//! not end the filing agent's session, so a stage in `NeedsAdjudication` still
//! names a live, idle agent, and one escalated with that agent in place would
//! be re-adopted by the executor as soon as an operator approved the review.
//! `Orchestrator::check_pending_disputes` retires the agent first and only
//! then calls [`Escalation::write`], which also closes the stage's open
//! disputes (`closed_disputes.rs`).
