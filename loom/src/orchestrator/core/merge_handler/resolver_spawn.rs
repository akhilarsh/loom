//! One pass of the daemon's merge-resolver spawn loop over a single
//! `MergeConflict`/`MergeBlocked` stage. Such a stage never counts as
//! terminal for the watch-mode exit (`recovery.rs::stage_file_is_terminal`),
//! so each pass leaves a resolver running, retries a transient failure, or
//! routes the stage to `NeedsHumanReview`. The stage copy a pass works from
//! can go stale while it runs git, so every routing is guarded
//! (`route_merge_stage_to_review`) and the stage is re-read before a resolver
//! is reserved. Relocated out of `merge_handler.rs` to keep it within its
//! maintainability-ledger line budget.
