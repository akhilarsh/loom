//! The daemon's sweep over merged stages that still hold a worktree or a
//! branch. Cleanup after a merge is deferred while a session still runs for
//! the stage, and a stage merged by the CLI from inside its own worktree
//! leaves the worktree behind. Nothing else revisits either, so each tick
//! retries them here, through the same `MergeLifecycle::cleanup` door that
//! refuses unless the stage's work is contained in the target branch.
