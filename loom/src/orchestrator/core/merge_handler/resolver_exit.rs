//! What the daemon does when a merge resolver's process ends. The resolver
//! merged the target into the stage branch in the stage worktree; the daemon
//! checks that worktree, merges the stage into the target with `merge_stage`,
//! and only then removes the worktree: the resolver has exited, so nothing
//! runs in it any more.
