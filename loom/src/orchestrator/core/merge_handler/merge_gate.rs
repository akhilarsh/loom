//! Merge gate: refuses to auto-merge, or hand to a merge-resolution session,
//! a stage branch whose diff since it split from the target touches a
//! control path — `.claude/`, `.mcp.json`, `.loom/`, or the tracked git
//! hooks directory. Owner decision 9, `doc/plans/PLAN-loom-state-confinement.md`
//! §9. The path rules live in `crate::git::merge::control_paths`, and
//! `merge_stage` enforces them on the commits it merges. These are the early
//! filters: `try_auto_merge` (before ever attempting the merge, so a
//! conflicting branch never gets that far either) and `resolver_spawn.rs`'s
//! `gate_holds_merge_stage` (for a stage that reached `MergeConflict` or
//! `MergeBlocked` some other way, e.g. `loom stage complete`).
