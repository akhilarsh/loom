//! The merge lifecycle driven through the daemon's own entry points with real
//! git: auto-merge, the blocked-merge retry, `--resolved` relayed through the
//! inbox, the resolver's exit, and the leftover sweep. Every scenario asserts,
//! after each step, what the operator's main checkout must keep: no
//! `MERGE_HEAD`, the same `HEAD` and bytes unless the step is the
//! fast-forward of the target.
