//! Fast-forward the branch checked out in the operator's checkout while

//!
//! Git carries local changes through `merge --ff-only` when none sits on a
//! path the merge touches. When one does, the tracked changes are stashed
//! around the fast-forward after a dry run proves they reapply cleanly.
//! `reset --hard` and `--autostash` are never used: the latter writes
//! conflict markers into working files.
//!
//! The checkout is classified against the merged TREE, so a blocked attempt
//! writes no commit; the commit is written once the fast-forward is certain
//! to be tried (the dry run needs it too).
