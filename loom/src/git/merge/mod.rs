/// 1. Refuse while the operator has a merge, cherry-pick, revert or rebase
///    in progress in the checkout.
/// 2. Refuse while the target guard holds the target
///    ([`MergeBlock::TargetHeld`]), for every gate mode: the bypass covers the
///    stage's own control paths, never a target that moved outside loom.
/// 3. With [`MergeGate::Enforce`], hold a branch whose diff touches a control
///    path. The gate reads the same two commits that are merged, under the
///    lock, so a commit made to the branch while the lock was awaited cannot
///    slip past it.
/// 4. Compute the merge with `git merge-tree`; conflicts leave everything
///    untouched. With the gate enforced, the diff from the target to the
///    merged tree is gated as well.
/// 5. Advance the target with [`advance_target`], which writes the merge
///    commit with `git commit-tree` only when the advance can happen, and
///    move the guard's accepted tip along with it.
