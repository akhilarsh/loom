//! Read-only CLI views over an already-resolved source graph.
//!
//! Every view is a pure `render_*` / `*_json` pair; the command layer owns
//! reading windows, printing and exit codes, and `compose` assembles one
//! request's views and the invocation-wide footer.
//!
//! None of these views fail on an empty result — a view that finds nothing
//! still renders a plain sentence saying so, because "the graph has no
//! answer" is not an error condition for a CLI query.
//!
//! Confidence and provenance are never flattened away: every row that comes
//! from `crate::context::impact` renders its own confidence, provenance, and
//! edge kind rather than collapsing them into a single generic line. And
//! reachability is never overclaimed: an empty reverse-impact result names
//! what was left untraversed (unresolved edges, symbol-less files) instead of
//! reading as "provably nothing depends on this".
