# Agent Rule-Bending Hardening

> Bendable checks, hardening backlog

## Why This Entry Exists (2026-09-16)

A review put the claim: *"some operations are forbidden if `LOOM_*` env vars are set, and an agent
is smart enough to unset them, so loom has no security."* Examined against the tree at base
`7504369c` on 2026-09-16.

The claim is accurate for one of three enforcement classes and wrong about the other two. The
classes are below, then the gaps the review actually turned up. **No incident is reported here** —
this is a read of the code, and every item states what was verified and what was not.

## The Three Enforcement Classes

| Class | Where the check runs | Whose environment it sees | What it can be trusted for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The loom CLI, invoked from a Bash tool call | The agent's shell — agent-controlled | Routing, error messages |
| 2 | A hook script | Claude Code's process — not agent-controlled, but the hook reads agent-authored command text | Workflow, accidents, deterrence |
| 3 | The daemon, or `loom hook relay` inside a hook | Irrelevant: identity comes from process ancestry and file ownership | Authority |

### Class 1 — env read in the agent's own shell

Every loom CLI call an agent makes reads its identity from its own process environment:
`commands/stage/control_session.rs:124-131` (`WrapperEnv::from_process_env`), `relay/emit.rs:68-75`,
`commands/memory/handlers/record.rs:120`, `commands/handoff/create.rs:287-299`,
`commands/subagents/render.rs:61`. `env -u LOOM_STAGE_ID loom …` changes what all of them see. The
review's claim holds here exactly.

It buys nothing, because none of them grants a capability. `route_control_session`
(`commands/stage/control_session.rs:161-209`) uses the variables to choose *between* the broker
route and the in-process route; unset them and the in-process route is taken, which then fails
writing `.loom/work` because the capsule mounts it read-only. **Env selects a route; the sandbox
and the ancestry checks grant the right.**

### Class 2 — hook process

Hooks are spawned by the Claude Code process and inherit *its* environment — the wrapper script's
exports — not the Bash tool's shell. An `unset` inside a tool call mutates one shell and dies with
it; the PreToolUse hook inspecting that same call still sees the real values.

Hooks also run *outside* the OS sandbox. Internal proof: `loom hook relay` writes `W/inbox/`, which
the session's own capsule denies — if hooks ran under the capsule the relay could not function at
all.

The reachable attack on class 2 is the settings `env` block, which overrides process env (see
[Session Identity Env](../mistakes/session-identity-env.md)). It is closed by
`fs/permissions/settings.rs::scrub_session_identity_env` and by every capsule denying `.claude` in
both layers (`sandbox/control_surfaces/session_denies.rs:89-103`, `sandbox/control_surfaces.rs:56-69`).

What remains is command-text matching, which is bypassable and documented as such —
`loom-hooks/commit-filter.sh:12-28`: *"command substitution that builds `git` from pieces, `$IFS`
tricks, `base64|sh`, or spawning git from a child interpreter… The DURABLE guarantee is
architectural."* Its anti-evasion guard covers two spellings of the gate unset
(`gate_var_unset_intent`, `commit-filter.sh:179-190`) and bare `eval`.

**Observed gap in that guard:** nothing checks `git commit --no-verify`, which skips the installed
pre-commit hook (`loom-hooks/git-pre-commit-hook.sh`, the staged-path check) outright.

### Class 3 — trusted host

- `daemon/server/peer_identity.rs:157-185` — `SO_PEERCRED` pid, a pid-file start-time match so a
  recycled pid cannot stand in, then an ancestry walk. Fails closed on `Unverifiable`, deliberately
  the opposite of the liveness helpers.
- `commands/hook/relay.rs:206-246` — the hook process must sit inside the claimed session's process
  tree, the scratch dir must be the one loom derives (0700, uid-owned), and the ticket must match
  the hash printed in the relay line.

Forging `LOOM_SESSION_ID` to name another session fails the ancestry walk. Env supplies the claim;
process ancestry and file ownership supply the proof.

### The rule that falls out

If the agent controls a value, the worst it may buy is a wrong route or a worse error message,
never a capability. Every new `LOOM_*` consumer should be answerable against that question *at its
call site*, without reading three modules to find out which class it is in.

## Gaps Found

### G1 — Commits are policed by text matching rather than by who can commit

`commit-filter.sh`, `commit-guard.sh`, `git-add-guard.sh` and the installed pre-commit hook all
exist to police who commits and which paths get staged. All four are class 2: text matching, best
effort by their own headers, and `--no-verify` walks past the last one.

**Fix direction:** route commits through the relay that already exists (`relay/*`, `fs/inbox/*`,
`orchestrator/core/inbox_drain/*`). The agent requests "commit these paths, this message"; the
daemon commits on the host from the worktree. Subagent commits become impossible rather than
discouraged, `git add -A` staging `.loom` becomes impossible, `--no-verify` becomes meaningless,
and path policy applies where the commit actually happens. PLAN-sandbox-escape-hardening adopts
this for worktree sessions (decision D1, `loom commit`). Its daemon never runs `git add` on
agent-written paths: git `lstat`s a path and then `open`s it without `O_NOFOLLOW`, so an agent
swapping a file for a symlink to a host secret between the two would have the daemon, outside the
sandbox, commit the secret. The daemon opens each file itself with a no-follow walk and hashes it.

### G2 — The worktree git-directory surface is not denied

- **The grant.** Claude Code adds the whole git common directory (`R/.git`) to the `allowWrite`
  of every session whose cwd is a linked worktree, denying only `hooks`, `config*`, `commondir`
  and the alternates files ([Execution Containment](../architecture/execution-containment.md),
  "Claude Code Grants a Linked Worktree Its Whole Git Common Directory"). Loom adds only
  `R/.git/hooks` and `R/.git/config` (`sandbox/control_surfaces/session_denies.rs`).
- **What a stage can do**, each shown in a scratch repository: move `main` or any branch and
  rewrite sibling stages' `refs/heads/loom/*`; replace a loose object that `git show` and
  `git checkout` then serve with exit 0 (only a full `git fsck` notices); plant `MERGE_HEAD` so the
  operator's next plain `git commit` in `R` becomes a merge with the agent's history; rewrite
  `R/.git/index`, which that commit then records. The merge gate fails open besides
  (`merge_handler/merge_gate.rs` and the `commits_ahead_of` probe in `merge_handler.rs` log and
  proceed when they cannot compute the diff).
- **No deny-list narrows it:** denies cannot be reopened for the stage's own ref, write globs are
  skipped on Linux, an absent-path deny shows the host an empty placeholder file, and a commit
  needs `R/.git` itself writable for `packed-refs.lock`.
- **Host-side git follows the agent's pointer.** A rewritten `T/.git` naming a directory whose
  config defines a clean filter makes a host `git status` in `T` run it
  (`verify/contracts/test_support.rs::plant_foreign_git_dir`); `git/runner.rs` disables hooks and
  `core.fsmonitor`, not filters, and the shell hooks run bare git. Discovering callers:
  `monitor/parked.rs`, `handoff/session_content.rs`, `verify/before_after.rs`,
  `merge_lifecycle/containment.rs`, `git/cleanup/removal.rs`, `git/cleanup/worktree.rs`,
  `git/merge/in_progress.rs`; on an operator's host `loom stage complete` also
  `verify/criteria/cache_fingerprint.rs`, `verify/wiring_detection.rs`,
  `verify/duplicate_detection.rs`, `context/worktree_graph.rs`; hooks `commit-guard.sh`,
  `stage-terminal-guard.sh`, `codex-forward-guard.sh` (`poll-guard.sh`,
  `no-preexisting-failures.sh` and `_progress-classification.sh` run no git).
- **A planted `commondir` in `R/.git`** redirects every discovery-based git call in `R`;
  `GIT_COMMON_DIR` stops it, `GIT_DIR` alone does not. Checkout-rooted sessions (knowledge stages,
  merge resolution, an adjudicator in `R`) can plant it.

**Fix direction:** PLAN-sandbox-escape-hardening: deny the whole common directory to stage,
contract and adjudication sessions and let the daemon commit (D1), pin host-side git (D2), verify
checkout-rooted sessions' effect on `R/.git` (D7), and fail the merge gate closed.

### G3 — No end-to-end proof that any denial holds

Everything above describes configuration, not observed behaviour.
[Sandbox and Confinement Gaps](sandbox-and-confinement-gaps.md) records that CI has no
credentialed runtime and denial verification is manual release validation. The srt harness
(`orchestrator/terminal/native/tests_confinement_srt.rs`, run outside any sandbox with
`LOOM_TEST_REQUIRE_SANDBOX_FREE=1` and a PATH shim for `srt`) passed manually on 2026-09-14, and
it cannot test the git directory: srt (`@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime` 0.0.78) shares Claude
Code's bind logic but not its linked-worktree grant, so `R/.git` is read-only under srt whatever
the capsule says. It probes no `denyRead` path either.

**Fix direction:** run it in CI with that shim and add a probe per deny worth keeping — the state
root, the credentials, the attestation key, `.claude`, the git common directory. The srt
translation must add the common-dir grant Claude Code makes, or a refusal there proves nothing.
Each probe needs the matched positive/negative control pair
[Execution Containment](../architecture/execution-containment.md) prescribes, or a green probe
cannot distinguish "denied" from "the harness never ran". PLAN-sandbox-escape-hardening also adds
an in-session canary that reads the session's own capsule and runs inside a live stage sandbox in
integration-verify.

## What Hardening Cannot Fix

Agent-written code reaches `main` through auto-merge and then runs unsandboxed on the operator's
machine at the next build. That is the trust boundary of the whole design, and no sandbox change
moves it. The achievable goal is narrower: containment that depends on nothing the agent can type,
and rule-bending that fails loudly and stays visible.

## Gaps Found (continued): G4-G7

### G4 — Detection lags prevention

The realistic failure is an overindulgent agent taking a shortcut, not an attacker. Such an agent
leaves evidence the daemon can see from outside the sandbox: a diff touching files outside the
stage's declared `files:` ownership, a commit whose session does not match the stage, a completion
whose gate never ran.

**Fix direction:** extend the merge gate beyond control paths to declared-ownership violations, and
surface them as a stage-level flag in `loom status`. This catches the realistic case somewhere the
agent cannot reach, and it scales better than a ninth text matcher.

### G5 — `spawn_confined`'s allowlist serves two consumers

Already open in [Sandbox and Confinement Gaps](sandbox-and-confinement-gaps.md), restated because
the review confirmed it: `process/environment.rs` withholds `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` as a live credential
socket while forwarding `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` and `XAUTHORITY`, which reach
`org.freedesktop.secrets` and the X11 session by the same argument. The terminal spawner needs those
variables; `spawn_confined` does not.

**Fix direction:** a base list for confined commands plus a terminal-only extension, and derive the
shell copy in `orchestrator/terminal/native/wrapper.rs:181-195` from the Rust constant with a test
pinning the two together — which also closes the documented divergence in proxy variables, CA bundle
locations and `CARGO_HOME`.

### G6 — Acceptance commands execute agent-written code on the host

`spawn_confined` is environment scrubbing and nothing else — no namespace, no seccomp, no network
restriction ([Execution Containment](../architecture/execution-containment.md) states this with
three proofs). Plan-authored commands are trusted text, but they compile and run agent-authored
code (`cargo test` runs the stage's own `build.rs`), so where they run decides the exposure:

- **In a session.** `loom stage complete` runs as a sandboxed control session
  (`commands/stage/control_session.rs::sandbox_control_session`), so acceptance, setup, wiring
  tests, contract runs and impact-selected tests execute inside the session's own sandbox. The
  daemon's `CompleteStage` (`daemon/server/control_complete.rs`) runs no plan or worktree command:
  it reads files and runs pinned git.
- **On the host.** Worktree content executes when an operator runs `loom stage complete`,
  `loom verify` or `loom check` outside a session (no `LOOM_STAGE_ID` or `LOOM_SESSION_ID`, so
  `sandbox_control_session` returns no session), and when the daemon runs a stage's
  `before_stage` truth commands at spawn (`orchestrator/core/stage_executor.rs` →
  `verify/before_after.rs`). `before_stage` is skipped when `find_prior_stage_work` reports
  commits or changes in a reused worktree, and that probe discovers git through `T/.git` (G2).

**Fix direction:** run host-side acceptance under the stage's own sandbox profile — `srt` is
invokable from the daemon, and doing so would make "prove this outbound connection is denied" an
expressible criterion instead of an unsatisfiable one — or state the boundary where an operator
reads it rather than only in `concerns/`. PLAN-sandbox-escape-hardening pins
`find_prior_stage_work` (D2) and leaves the operator's host path as it is.

### G7 — Standing accepted risks that deserve a decision

- **Shared package caches** (`sandbox/package_caches.rs::PACKAGE_MANAGER_CACHE_WRITE_PATHS`,
  emitted into every capsule's `allowWrite`) are writable by every session and executed by the
  operator's own next build: cargo does not re-verify extracted sources, so an edited `build.rs`
  under `~/.cargo/registry/src` runs on the host. This is the cheapest escape in the system, far
  easier than defeating any hook. PLAN-sandbox-escape-hardening (decision D3) gives each session
  its own cache over read-only views of the real ones; detail in
  [State Confinement Gaps](state-confinement-gaps.md).
- **Three `pub`-but-uncalled path-escape validators** (`sandbox/config.rs`: `detect_path_escape`,
  `validate_paths`, `is_legitimate_work_access`) still read as protection. Wire them in or delete
  them.
- **Attestation key confidentiality** holds in the capsule: every stage capsule's `denyRead` names
  `<state root>/completion-attestation.key` beside `admin.token` and `user.token` (seen in a live
  stage capsule on 2026-10-01), and `loom-hooks/credential-guard.sh` blocks the three for the file
  tools whatever the settings say. No probe from inside a session has confirmed the OS deny; the
  key's confidentiality is what keeps forged completion evidence out.

## Stage Agents Stop and Report Instead of Disputing or Blocking

The doctrine is BLOCK-F (`orchestrator/signals/helpers.rs::STAGE_EXIT_RULES`, byte-identical in `skills/loom-orchestration/SKILL.md`, pinned by `tests_doctrine_v2.rs`): a wrong criterion, wiring check, contract, review finding or test-integrity event gets a dispute, whose filing ends the session by design; a need only a person can meet gets `loom stage block <stage-id> "<reason>"`. A stage agent's block retires the stage's live session and shows the reason in `loom status` (`orchestrator/core/event_handler/blocked.rs`). `loom plan verify` checks the plan's environment (provision entries, registry domains, JS packages without provision, pre-commit hook network needs; see [plan-lifecycle-and-fields](../architecture/plan-lifecycle-and-fields.md)). Open gaps:

- **Subagents are told by text only.** `loom-hooks/commit-filter.sh` blocks a subagent's `loom stage complete` and git commands mechanically, but `loom stage block` and `dispute-*` rely on the `_subagent-preamble.txt` line. A subagent block now retires the main session, so the hook branch should refuse them too. `agents/loom-software-engineer.md` and the coordinator preamble in `skills/loom-orchestration/SKILL.md` do not repeat the report-instead-of-file rule, so an untyped spawn that pastes only BLOCK-A never receives it.
- **BLOCK-F and commit timing disagree.** BLOCK-F says to commit before filing; `append_commit_timing_rules` in the same signal prefix says commit only as the final step. The commit-timing text needs an exception for a dispute or block.
- **A surviving agent on a Blocked stage is never retried.** When retirement leaves survivors, `blocked.rs` warns once; `StageBlocked` is not re-emitted. Only `loom stage reset --kill-session` clears it.
- **Duplicated block mutation.** The `NotListening` arm of `commands/stage/state_relay.rs` repeats the `try_mark_blocked` / `close_reason` / `failure_info` / `updated_at` writes of `handle_block_stage`; `event_handler/stage_takedown.rs::retirable_agents` repeats the session assembly of `stage_agents`. Each pair can drift.
