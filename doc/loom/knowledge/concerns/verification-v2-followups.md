## Nine Adapters Have Fixtures From Documented Formats, Not Captured Runs

`cargo-nextest`, `gradle`, `maven`, `sbt`, `rspec`, `phpunit`, `pest`, `swift-test` and `mix-test` have fixtures under
`loom/src/testrun/fixtures/<adapter>/` written from the runner's documented output format, because the runner was not
installed on the recording host. Each directory carries a `PROVENANCE.md`; the other 14 adapters were captured from real
runs. Their parsers are unproven against real output until someone records a live run and replaces the fixture.

Open parser and command gaps found while writing the language skills, checked against the tree on 2026-09-25:

- **swift-test** reads only XCTest's `Executed N tests`. Swift Testing (`@Test`) prints `Test run with N tests`, so a
  filter selecting only Swift Testing tests parses `executed 0` and reads as `NotSelected` at freeze and completion.
- **maven** runs `mvn -q test -Dtest=...`; quiet mode suppresses Surefire's `Tests run:` line on a passing run, so a
  passing contract likely parses `Unparsed` (exit 0 passes with a warning) instead of `Passed`.
- **pest** `--filter <name>`: the mechanism by which a multi-word description reaches PHPUnit's name filter was not
  found in Pest's source. Run one through the real runner when Pest is available.
- **ctest** runs `cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir build ...` relative to the package dir. `scan.rs` makes every
  directory with a `CMakeLists.txt` a package, so a contract under a `tests/CMakeLists.txt` runs where no `build/`
  exists and completion can never pass. Nothing configures `build/`. Fix by walking up to the configured CMake root.
- **minitest** runs `ruby -Itest <file>` without `bundle exec`, unlike rspec with a `Gemfile`.
- **JVM**: `mvn` is taken from `PATH` even when `./mvnw` exists; every Gradle subproject with its own `build.gradle*`
  is a separate package and falls back to `gradle` on `PATH`; Android (`test` aggregate) and Kotlin Multiplatform
  (`jvmTest`) modules have no plain `test` task for `--tests`.
- **csharp** detection needs a `*.csproj` or `*.sln`; a directory holding only `.slnx` is not detected (project
  directories beneath it still are).
- **dart** `--plain-name` is a substring match, so a description contained in another test's name selects both.
- The test-file globs for swift, dart, csharp, cpp, java, kotlin, scala, ruby, php and elixir were not pinned by the
  design; `testrun/languages.rs` is the authority and the language skills describe conventions only.

## Verification v2 Known Gaps

- **Contract outcomes are self-attested.** The daemon re-derives changed paths from git but does not re-run agent-written
  contract tests (untrusted code outside the sandbox). A raw-socket client could report `failed` for an
  already-passing contract; completion re-runs every frozen contract and requires a pass. Security review accepted it.
- **Tracking-key collision.** `loom-contract-<id>` (Contract session of stage `<id>`) equals the Stage key of a stage named
  `contract-<id>`; `orphan_candidates.rs:21-34` matches pid-file stems by prefix, so after a daemon restart the scanner
  can adopt one stage's process into the other. Same class as the `merge-`, `knowledge-` and `adjudication-` prefixes;
  `validation.rs` `RESERVED_NAMES` reserves none of them.
- **Escalated contract stage.** `loom stage retry` refuses `NeedsHumanReview`; the stage reaches retry only through
  `human-review --reject` (`Blocked`), and `human-review --approve` requeues without resetting the contract budget.
- **Continuation writer.** After a ceiling handoff the replacement contract writer gets a fresh contract signal without
  its predecessor's handoff (`generate_contract_signal` takes no handoff file).
- **Stale wiring pin from another stage.** Integration-verify has no self-service channel for it: `dispute-criteria` takes an
  acceptance index and the daemon admits a dispute only for the caller's own stage (`daemon/server/self_service.rs:86-94`).
  The repair is an operator `loom stage amend --field wiring`. Consider a dispute kind for aggregated wiring gaps, or
  have the aggregated check name the amend command.
- **Target-branch resolution differs.** `commands/hook/review_harvest.rs:119` resolves from the stage worktree, completion
  and both `loom stage review` commands from the CWD repo root. They agree while the CWD is inside the repo; share
  `commands/stage/review_status.rs::stage_worktree_and_target`.
- **Journal splitting.** `fs/memory/parser.rs:30` treats any line starting `###` as an entry header and `validate_content`
  checks length only, so a note or suggestion whose text starts with `###` splits the journal. Review harvest flattens
  suggestions to one line but does not escape a leading `###`.
- **Impact selection misses macro-only use** (`context/extract/rust.rs:19`) and skips every test in a contract file.
- **Reachable by bare name** passes when any symbol of that name is reached from any `from` node; common names (`run`,
  `handle`) can false-pass. `Partial` coverage counts as checked in definition-site exclusion.
- **`loom plan verify` does not check where contracts run.** A stage with `contracts` whose `working_dir` has no manifest
  for the contract's adapter (`Cargo.toml` for cargo) verifies clean, although every contract command then exits
  non-zero: `cargo test <name> -- --exact` takes no manifest path. See
  [verification-v2-delivery.md](../mistakes/verification-v2-delivery.md). A preflight check could resolve each
  contract's adapter and require its manifest in `working_dir`.
- **Integrity blind spot.** A file marked skip-worktree or assume-unchanged hides its edits from the `git diff` the
  fingerprint and the count totals trust. `verify::integrity::current_events` has no production caller (kept for the
  pinned dispute-kinds API).
- **Duplicated helpers** to unify: `verify/review/store.rs::canonical_work_dir` and the private one in
  `verify/contracts/store.rs`; `daemon/server/contracts.rs::locate` and `adjudication/apply_contract.rs::stage_working_dir`
  (~20 lines); the journal walk in `signals/v2_section_review.rs` and `commands/memory/handlers/pending.rs::staged_entries`;
  `CwdGuard` copied into four test files; `verify/utils.rs` `.size_limit(1 << 20)` versus `wiring.rs` `PATTERN_SIZE_LIMIT`.
- **Slow hook tests** (`loom-hooks/tests/run-all.sh` is 162 s after the PATH-fixture fix): `prefer-modern-tools-missing-rg-fd.sh`
  78 s, `poll-guard-subagent-waits.sh` 63 s, and four others near 40 s.

## Provision Install Validation Gaps

Plan authors are trusted, so these are author-mistake gaps, not stage-agent bypasses. The validator is `plan/schema/validation/v2_fields/provision_installs.rs`; the required forms are in [plan-environment](../architecture/plan-lifecycle-and-fields.md#plan-provision-snapshot-spawn-gate-hardening).

- **Indirection is not seen through.** Install detection takes the first non-flag word as the subcommand, so `npm --prefix web ci`, `bun --cwd web install`, `pnpm -C web install`, `env -C web bun install` (`command_start` stops at the `-C` value) and `corepack pnpm install` are not checked. `changes_directory` does not see through `eval`: `refusal && eval 'cd web' && bun install ...` moves the install unflagged, and `eval "bun install"` escapes install detection. Fix: parse `eval`'s argument as a nested script in `nested_scripts`, or reject the wrappers.
- **The `.npmrc` refusal tests only the entry's directory.** For a `working_dir` nested in an npm or pnpm workspace the root `.npmrc` may still be read. Document `working_dir` as the workspace root or check the ancestors.
- **Yarn.** Yarn classic reads `.yarnrc` `yarn-path` and yarn berry reads the yarn berry config `yarnPath`; both run a repository JS file on the host even with `--ignore-scripts`. Berry also rejects `--frozen-lockfile` and `--ignore-scripts` (it wants `--immutable`), and `YARN_INSTALL` uses classic syntax. Validation checks only `--ignore-scripts` and the `.npmrc` refusal.
- **uv.** `uv sync --frozen --no-install-project` still builds sdist dependencies through their build backends on the host and reads agent-writable the uv config and `[tool.uv]` project index settings (a registry redirect like `.npmrc`). Validation requires only `--no-install-project`.
- **Host caches.** The stage sandbox can write `~/.bun/install/cache`, `~/.npm` and the pnpm store (`sandbox/package_caches.rs`), which the host provision reads with the operator's `HOME`. `--backend=copyfile` stops writes back into the bun cache but not a poisoned extracted entry, and a committed `web/node_modules` symlink is an untested channel. Fix: seed or isolate the cache for provision (see [state-confinement-gaps](state-confinement-gaps.md)).
- **Module cycle.** `visit_argvs` (`v2_lints/mod.rs`) is used by `v2_fields::provision_installs`, while `v2_lints::js_provision` imports the hardened constants from `v2_fields`. Moving `visit_argvs` next to `command_start` and `nested_scripts` in `criterion_hazards.rs` removes it.

## Provision Gate and Environment Lint Gaps

- **Before/after comparison by entry string.** `provision_gate.rs` matches `git status` entry strings, so a provision that rewrites a file already listed before it ran passes the ignored-files-only rule. Compare content (a hash of the diff and untracked files) or document the limit.
- **`loom init` prints no provision entries.** The operator cannot see which host commands the plan will run unsandboxed; listing them at init would show it.
- **Duplicated code.** `block_for_provision` repeats `persist_blocked_stage` (`stage_executor.rs`) plus `close_reason` and the graph mark; `write/read_provision_snapshot` re-implement `config_sections.rs` `write_section/read_section` including a toml to `toml_edit` round trip; `merge_gate.rs::hooks_dir_prefix` reads `--local/--global/--system` itself while `git/hooks.rs::configured_hooks_path` implements the same precedence.
- **Hook lint false negatives.** `repo_hooks.rs` skips a symlinked hook (`ln -s ../../scripts/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit`) and does not expand a `~/` `core.hooksPath`. A multi-link file is not refused (no impact: hook content is never echoed and `.git` is write-denied).
- **Registry lint.** `registry_domains.rs` ignores the stage's `excluded_commands` (which run outside the sandbox), so it errors for a command that can already reach the network; `npm --prefix web install` and bare `yarn` are missed; `--offline` installs are over-reported. `sandboxed_commands` filters by the `BEFORE_STAGE_LABEL` label prefix; a `sandboxed` flag on `StageCommand` would not depend on label text.
- **JS lint advice.** `js_provision.rs` tells a package with no lockfile to install with `npm ci` after committing a lockfile, even when its runner is bun.

## Completion-Gate and Dispute Backlog

- `format_gate.rs` builds a `Stage::default()` whose empty id makes `${STAGE_ID}` expand to an empty string, contradicting the module doc; `biome check` also lints, so a lint error in a contract file is reported with "run the formatter" advice; the formatter-gate tests (`freeze_tests.rs`) need a host `rustfmt` binary.
- Three enums mirror the dispute field (`DisputeField` in `cli/types_stage_disputes.rs`, `AmendField`, `CriterionField`), and `dispute_criteria_with_mode` takes nine arguments under `allow(too_many_arguments)`.
- Other `std::env::set_current_dir` tests (`commands/knowledge/tests*.rs`, `telemetry/tests.rs`) restore the cwd by hand and are not panic-safe; the guard in `commands/stage/state_relay.rs` tests could become a shared `CwdGuard`.
- `commands/status/data/collector.rs::build_stage_summary` stays under the 50-line ledger through `let (facts, now) = (...)`; moving the ledger entry or extracting a helper is the cleaner fix.

## Test Gaps Recorded by Reviewers

- No test drives `loom init` with a provision plan and reads the snapshot back; passing `LoomConfig::default()` instead of the parsed plan's loom config survives the wiring regex (`commands/init/plan_setup.rs`).
- `start_stage` reaching `pre_spawn_gates_passed` is checked by a source regex only; a runtime test that a failing provision stops the spawn would pin it.
- Git-status tolerance of a failing listing is covered only through a non-git `TempDir`, which depends on `TMPDIR` not sitting inside a repository.
- An unreadable or unparsable manifest counting as declaring dependencies (`impact_tests/runs.rs`) and a manifest over 256 KiB (`skills/project/tests.rs`) have no test.
- `joined_by_and`'s `|`, `&` and parenthesis arms have no test (`plan/schema/tests/v2_tests.rs`); the `pushd web && refusal && install` case fails the `opens` check first, so it does not guard `changes_directory`.
- `crash-blocked-stage-is-not-an-agent-block` covers a crash with retries left only; a `(_, Some(reason))` arm placed after the auto-retry arm is caught only by `attention_model_guidance_tests.rs`. `pre-commit-hook-registry-need-is-an-error` has no negative control (unit tests cover it). The `close_reason` sanitizer test asserts only the absence of ESC and bidi characters, not the flattened text.

## Contract Freeze Format Gate Recognises a Fixed Formatter List

`verify/contracts/format_gate.rs` treats an acceptance criterion as a formatter check only when its command text matches `FLAG_CHECKS`, the biome rule or `SCRIPT_CHECKS`: cargo fmt, rustfmt, prettier, oxfmt, ruff format, black, biome, and `format:check` scripts. A plan with no match gets no gate, and other languages (Go, C/C++, Elixir, .NET, Dart, Swift, Ruby, Kotlin) are not covered. `gofmt -l` is excluded because it prints unformatted files and exits 0.

**Options, none implemented:**

- A `format_check: bool` field on `TruthCheck` (`models/stage/checks.rs`, `deny_unknown_fields`, serde default and skip-if-false like `WiringCheck.literal`), honoured by `is_format_check`. A Simple (string) criterion cannot carry it. The field must be threaded through plan amendment (`plan/amendment.rs`, `plan/amendment_fields.rs`), `acceptance_command.rs` validation, the adjudication prompt and `verify/criteria/cache_contract.rs` (pass-cache keys); check whether it needs the `version: 2` gate.
- A `stdout_empty` field beside `stderr_empty`, so `gofmt -l .` fails on any output without a `test -z` wrapper.
- A narrower rule recognising `test -z "$(gofmt -l ...)"` and more formatter commands in `format_gate.rs`, one file, no schema; `invocations()` splits subshells and pipelines, so each accepted shape needs a test, with near-miss tests as the module already has.
