# K1: the in-session sandbox canary and the stage-sandbox probe surface

Stage `sandbox-canary`, one wave with K2, tier sonnet. Read `../common.md` first.

## Why

Unit tests on `build_settings` output prove what the capsule says, never what a live sandbox
does with it (`concerns/sandbox-and-confinement-gaps.md`, "Sandbox Denial Has No End-to-End CI
Canary"). You write a test that runs inside a real loom stage session and proves, from the
session's own capsule, that every write and read this plan closes is refused while the paths
the session needs stay open. Outside a live stage sandbox it prints a loud skip line and
passes; `LOOM_TEST_REQUIRE_STAGE_SANDBOX=1` turns that skip into a failure. Integration-verify
runs it with that flag after the operator reinstalls loom; in THIS stage it must skip (your
session's capsule was built by the pre-plan binary and has every hole: "This stage runs under
the OLD capsule" in common.md).

You also write the library surface K2's srt harness and the stage's contracts call.

You own: `loom/src/process/sandbox_probe.rs`, `loom/src/process/sandbox_probe/srt.rs` (new),
`loom/tests/sandbox_canary.rs` (new), `loom/tests/sandbox_canary/probes.rs`,
`loom/tests/sandbox_canary/layout.rs`, `loom/tests/sandbox_canary/checks.rs`,
`loom/tests/sandbox_canary/probe_tests.rs` (all new). Never write
`loom/tests/sandbox_canary_contracts.rs` (frozen contract file).

## What capsule-policy provides (merged before you start)

You use no Rust symbol capsule-policy adds. You read its effects from the session:

- D1: a worktree-rooted capsule lists the git common directory in
  `sandbox.filesystem.denyWrite`.
- D3: the session environment sets `CARGO_HOME=C/cargo` and the other D3 path variables, with
  `C = <user cache dir>/loom/session-caches/<stage-id>-<session-kind>` (shared by a stage's
  sessions; `C/.loom-session` names the session it was seeded for); `C` is in `allowWrite`; no real
  package cache is granted.
- D4: `denyRead` holds plain credential paths, `~/.codex/auth.json` for sessions the codex lane
  is not licensed for.
- D5: a worktree-rooted capsule has `R/.worktrees` in `denyRead` and `T` in
  `sandbox.filesystem.allowRead`.
- D6: a codex-licensed capsule grants `C`, `~/.codex/plugin-data` and `~/.codex/auth.json`,
  never `~/.codex`.

Derive every path at runtime: the capsule JSON, `git rev-parse`, `dirs::home_dir()`, the
environment. No literal home, uid, repository or cache path anywhere.

## Anchors (read at `3fc28031`; locate by symbol)

- `loom/src/process/sandbox_probe.rs` (196 lines): `skip_unless` :154 (the
  `LOOM_TEST_REQUIRE_SANDBOX_FREE` skip-or-panic), its tests :165-196.
- `loom/src/orchestrator/terminal/native/tests_confinement_srt.rs`: `srt_settings` :127,
  `srt_document` :142, `srt_path` :161 move into your `sandbox_probe/srt.rs` (K2 deletes them
  there and calls yours).
- `crate::orchestrator::terminal::native::session_settings_path(work_dir, session_id)`
  (`native/session_settings.rs:44`, `pub(crate)`, re-exported in `native/mod.rs:47`): the
  capsule path, `<work_dir>/capsules/<session_id>.settings.json`. Call it; do not rebuild it.
- `loom::git::runner::run_git_checked(args: &[&str], repo_root: &Path) -> Result<String>`
  (`git/runner.rs:129`): trimmed stdout of a successful git command.
- Dependencies already in `Cargo.toml`: `nix` with feature `fs` (`nix::sys::statfs::{statfs,
  TMPFS_MAGIC}`), `libc`, `dirs`, `serde_json`, `tempfile`. Add none.

## 1. The library surface (`sandbox_probe.rs`)

Refactor `skip_unless` into a private `skip_or_panic(probe_ok, test_name, why, require_var,
demand)` that both skips share; `skip_unless`'s text and behaviour stay byte-identical (its
existing tests and 18 callers must not notice). Then add, with doc comments:

    /// What a test process can see of the loom stage sandbox around it.
    #[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
    pub struct StageSandboxEvidence {
        pub stage_id: Option<String>,     // LOOM_STAGE_ID
        pub session_id: Option<String>,   // LOOM_SESSION_ID
        pub work_dir: Option<PathBuf>,    // LOOM_WORK_DIR
        pub capsule: Option<String>,      // the session capsule's text, when readable
        pub pid1_comm: Option<String>,    // /proc/1/comm trimmed; None off Linux or unreadable
        pub cargo_home: Option<PathBuf>,  // CARGO_HOME
        pub cache_owner: Option<String>,  // <CARGO_HOME's parent>/.loom-session, trimmed,
                                          // read only when it is a regular file
    }

    impl StageSandboxEvidence {
        /// Reads the process environment, the capsule, /proc/1/comm and the session
        /// cache's owner marker; an empty variable counts as unset. stage_id, session_id
        /// and work_dir come from LOOM_STAGE_ID, LOOM_SESSION_ID and LOOM_WORK_DIR, or,
        /// when one is unset, from LOOM_ACCEPTANCE_STAGE_ID, LOOM_ACCEPTANCE_SESSION_ID and
        /// LOOM_ACCEPTANCE_WORK_DIR: `loom stage complete` runs acceptance through
        /// spawn_confined, which withholds the LOOM_* names and exports these copies
        /// (capsule-policy, process/environment.rs).
        pub fn from_env() -> Self
    }

    /// Ok when the evidence shows a live loom stage sandbox under this plan's policy;
    /// Err naming the first missing piece. Never touches the filesystem.
    pub fn stage_sandbox_live(evidence: &StageSandboxEvidence) -> Result<(), String>

    /// false when `evidence` is live. Otherwise prints
    /// "SKIP <test_name>: <reason> (set LOOM_TEST_REQUIRE_STAGE_SANDBOX=1 to fail instead)"
    /// and returns true, or, when LOOM_TEST_REQUIRE_STAGE_SANDBOX=1, panics with
    /// "<test_name>: <reason> (LOOM_TEST_REQUIRE_STAGE_SANDBOX=1 demands a run inside a loom
    /// stage sandbox)".
    pub fn skip_unless_stage_sandbox(test_name: &str, evidence: &StageSandboxEvidence) -> bool

    /// One `sandbox.filesystem` entry as the path Claude Code reads it: `~/x` under `home`,
    /// `//x` and `/x` absolute, anything else under `cwd`; a trailing `/**` cut; None for any
    /// other glob (`*`, `?`, `[`, `{`).
    pub fn capsule_path(entry: &str, cwd: &Path, home: &Path) -> Option<PathBuf>

    /// The default locations under `home` of every package cache decision D3 relocates, with
    /// their Linux and macOS spellings, whether or not they exist.
    pub fn real_package_cache_dirs(home: &Path) -> Vec<PathBuf>

    pub mod srt;

`stage_sandbox_live` checks, in this order, with a reason naming the variable or file:
`stage_id`, `session_id` and `work_dir` present; `capsule` present and parsing as JSON with an
object at `sandbox.filesystem`; `pid1_comm == Some("bwrap")`; `cargo_home` present and
`cache_owner == session_id` (D3: `C` is `<stage-id>-<kind>`, a path shared by a stage's
sessions, and its owner marker `C/.loom-session` holds the id of the session it was seeded for;
never compare `C`'s directory name with the session id). A missing `CARGO_HOME` or a missing or
mismatched marker gives the same reason: "CARGO_HOME is not this session's cache (C/cargo with
C/.loom-session naming this session, decision D3): the session was spawned by a loom that
predates the sandbox-escape-hardening policy". That check is what makes the canary skip in this
stage and run in integration-verify; the flag turns it into a failure there.

`real_package_cache_dirs` lists exactly (home-relative): `.cargo/registry`, `.cargo/git`,
`.rustup/downloads`, `.rustup/tmp`, `.rustup/toolchains`, `.bun/install/cache`, `.npm`,
`.local/share/pnpm/store`, `.cache/pnpm`, `.local/state/pnpm`, `Library/pnpm/store`,
`Library/Caches/pnpm`, `.cache/yarn`, `Library/Caches/Yarn`, `.yarn/berry`, `.cache/deno`,
`Library/Caches/deno`, `.cache/uv`, `Library/Caches/uv`, `.cache/pip`, `Library/Caches/pip`,
`go/pkg`, `.cache/go-build`, `Library/Caches/go-build`. It is an oracle: never build it from
`sandbox/package_caches.rs` or any capsule-policy resolver, or a path dropped from both goes
unseen. Never use `dirs::cache_dir()` for it: inside a session `XDG_CACHE_HOME` points into `C`.

Add one unit test to the existing `tests` module: `capsule_path_reads_entries_the_way_claude_code_does`
(`~/a/**`, `//abs/b`, `/abs/c`, `rel/d/**`, and `a/*.rs` giving None).

## 2. The srt translation (`sandbox_probe/srt.rs`, new)

Move the translation out of `tests_confinement_srt.rs` (`srt_settings`, `srt_document`,
`srt_path` there; `srt_path` becomes your `capsule_path`) and extend it:

    /// The canonicalized git common directory of `cwd` when `cwd` lies in a linked worktree
    /// (`git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir` differs from `--git-dir`);
    /// None in a main checkout, outside git, or when git fails.
    pub fn linked_worktree_common_dir(cwd: &Path) -> Option<PathBuf>

    /// `capsule`'s `sandbox.filesystem` block as srt settings for a session in `cwd` with
    /// `home` as its home: {"filesystem": {"denyRead", "allowRead", "allowWrite",
    /// "denyWrite"}, "network": {"allowedDomains": [], "deniedDomains": []}}. Each list maps
    /// the capsule's list through `capsule_path` (None dropped, a missing list empty).
    /// allowWrite starts with `cwd`, then `linked_worktree_common_dir(cwd)` when Some (Claude
    /// Code grants a linked worktree its common directory; srt does not), then the capsule's.
    pub fn srt_settings(capsule: &Value, cwd: &Path, home: &Path) -> Value

Paths become JSON strings with `display()`. `srt_settings(&Value::Null, dir, dir)` must work (K2's
host probe uses it). Git goes through `run_git_checked`. Keep the module doc comment from
`tests_confinement_srt.rs` lines 5-7 (how the block is read).

## 3. The canary target

`tests/sandbox_canary.rs` is the crate root. Cargo discovers `tests/*/main.rs` as its own
target, so the helper directory holds no `main.rs` and no `mod.rs`: declare each helper with
`#[path = "sandbox_canary/<file>.rs"] mod <file>;` from the root.

The root holds the module doc (what it proves, why it skips, the flag) and:

    #[test]
    fn a_live_stage_sandbox_enforces_its_capsule() {
        let evidence = StageSandboxEvidence::from_env();
        if skip_unless_stage_sandbox("a_live_stage_sandbox_enforces_its_capsule", &evidence) {
            return;
        }
        // layout, report, checks::run_all, print report.tried, one assert listing every violation
    }

`layout.rs`: `SessionLayout { capsule: Value, session_id, home, toplevel, git_dir, common_dir,
checkout, cache }` built by `SessionLayout::discover(&StageSandboxEvidence) -> Result<Self,
String>`. `toplevel` is `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` run in `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")` (the
session cwd: relative capsule entries such as `loom/src/**` are relative to it); `git_dir` and
`common_dir` are `--path-format=absolute --git-dir` / `--git-common-dir`, canonicalized;
`checkout` (R) is `common_dir`'s parent; `cache` (C) is `CARGO_HOME`'s parent; `home` is
`dirs::home_dir()`. Methods: `worktree_rooted()` (`git_dir != common_dir`), `entries(key) ->
Vec<(String, Option<PathBuf>)>` (resolved with `capsule_path` against `toplevel` and `home`),
`codex_licensed()` (any `allowWrite` entry resolves under `home/.codex`).

`probes.rs`: a `Report { tried: Vec<String>, violations: Vec<String> }` whose every probe adds
one `tried` line ("<probe> <path>: <outcome>") and, on failure, one violation; and primitives,
each returning `Result<String, String>` (Ok = the outcome proven, Err = the violation):

- `create_refused(dir)`: `OpenOptions::new().write(true).create_new(true)` on a fresh name
  (`.loom-canary-<pid>-<counter>`, checked absent first). Ok only when it fails with EROFS,
  EACCES or EPERM (`raw_os_error` against `libc` constants) AND `symlink_metadata` then reports
  NotFound. A success removes the file and is Err; any other error is Err "unproven".
- `create_allowed(dir)`: the same open succeeds and the file is removed again.
- `append_refused(file)`: bytes read before, `OpenOptions::new().append(true).open`, bytes read
  after. Ok when the open fails with EROFS/EACCES/EPERM and the bytes match. An open that
  succeeds is dropped WITHOUT writing and is Err.
- `masked_file(path)`: Ok when `metadata` shows a character device (`FileTypeExt`) or the read
  fails with PermissionDenied; a regular file that reads is Err "readable (<n> bytes)". Never
  put file content in a report.
- `masked_dir(dir, allowed: &BTreeSet<OsString>)`: Ok when `is_tmpfs(dir)` and every listed
  name is in `allowed`; Err naming the extra names or "not a tmpfs".
- `is_tmpfs(path) -> bool`: `nix::sys::statfs::statfs(path)` type `== TMPFS_MAGIC` on Linux;
  `false` elsewhere (`#[cfg]` pair).

`checks.rs`: `run_all(&SessionLayout, &mut Report)` runs these in order, controls first.

| Check | Negative (must be refused or masked) | Matched positive control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (a) session cache, D3 | every D3 path variable set (CARGO_HOME, BUN_INSTALL_CACHE_DIR, npm_config_cache, npm_config_store_dir, YARN_CACHE_FOLDER, GOPATH, GOMODCACHE, GOCACHE, UV_CACHE_DIR, PIP_CACHE_DIR, DENO_DIR, XDG_CACHE_HOME; CODEX_HOME iff codex-licensed) lies under C, else a violation; a missing one is a violation | `create_allowed` in C and in each variable's directory (`create_dir_all` first); `create_allowed` in `env!("CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR")` (the worktree's target dir); some `allowWrite` entry resolves to C |
| (b) git common dir, D1 (worktree-rooted only) | `create_refused` in `common_dir`, `common_dir/refs/heads`, `common_dir/objects`, `git_dir` (W); `append_refused` on `common_dir/HEAD`, and on `git_dir/index` when it exists | the `CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR` control of (a) |
| (c) real caches, D3 | `create_refused` in every `real_package_cache_dirs(home)` entry that is a directory | C writable, from (a) |
| (d) credential reads, D4 | every `denyRead` entry that exists: a file or character device is `masked_file`; a directory is `masked_dir`, allowed = the first component below it of each resolved `allowRead`/`allowWrite` entry and `toplevel`, plus `.claude` and `.mcp.json` when the directory is R, `R/.worktrees` or T | `read_dir(home)` yields at least one entry; the first non-empty regular file directly in `home` that no `denyRead` entry covers reads at least one byte (none found is a `tried` note) |
| (e) sibling worktrees, D5 (worktree-rooted, T directly in `R/.worktrees`) | `R/.worktrees` lists nothing but T's name, after dropping `.claude` and `.mcp.json` | T's name is listed and `read_dir(toplevel)` is non-empty |
| (f) codex home, D6 | `create_refused` in `home/.codex` when it exists; when not codex-licensed, `masked_file` on `home/.codex/auth.json` when it exists | the (a) controls; when licensed, CODEX_HOME lies under C |
| (g) static grants | no resolved `allowWrite` entry equals, lies inside or contains an entry of `real_package_cache_dirs(home)`, or (worktree-rooted) `common_dir`; glob entries are `tried` notes | none: a pure check of the capsule |

A checkout-rooted session (a Knowledge stage running the suite) skips (b), (e) and (g)'s
common-dir part with a `tried` note: D7 keeps its `.git` writable by design, apart from the
entries D7 denies, which K2's srt test covers (a probe here would need a positive write inside
the operator's real `.git`). An absent path is a
`tried` note, never a violation and never a pass.

## 4. Probe primitive tests (`probe_tests.rs`, always run)

These run in this stage and give each primitive its matched pair. Build every path in a
`tempfile::Builder::tempdir_in(env!("CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR"))`; restore permissions before the
TempDir drops. Exact names:

- `a_create_probe_is_refused_in_a_read_only_directory_and_lands_in_a_writable_one`: a 0o555
  directory gives Ok from `create_refused` and nothing in it; a writable one gives Err from
  `create_refused`, Ok from `create_allowed`, and is empty afterwards.
- `an_append_probe_is_refused_on_a_read_only_file_and_opens_a_writable_one`: a 0o444 file gives
  Ok and unchanged bytes; a 0o644 file gives Err and unchanged bytes.
- `a_masked_file_probe_accepts_dev_null_and_rejects_a_readable_file`: `/dev/null` is Ok; a file
  holding "secret" is Err and the Err text does not contain "secret".
- `the_tmpfs_probe_agrees_with_the_mount_table` (Linux): the first `tmpfs` mount point in
  `/proc/self/mounts` that is a readable directory gives true (none found: a SKIP line through
  `loom::process::sandbox_probe::skip_unless`); `env!("CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR")` gives false unless
  its longest-prefix mount in that table is a tmpfs.

The two permission tests skip through `skip_unless` when `nix::unistd::geteuid().is_root()`:
root ignores permission bits.

## Traps

- The sentinel rule (`mistakes/verification-harness.md`, "A Must-Fail Probe That Counts Any
  Non-Zero Exit Passes When the Harness Never Started"): a refusal counts only with its errno
  AND the path unchanged; the positive controls run first, so a probe that "passes" because
  nothing works is reported as a failed control.
- `test -w` and `access(2)` report WRITABLE on a `/dev/null` bind: never decide writability from
  permissions or metadata. Only a real open decides.
- Never create, truncate or write an existing file: fresh names with `create_new`, append-open
  without a write. Every file a probe created is removed; a failed removal is a violation.
- `Path::exists` hides PermissionDenied; use `metadata` and match the error kind.
- Claude Code mounts `/dev/null` placeholders named `.claude` and `.mcp.json` at R, `R/.worktrees`
  and T: filter those names only there.
- `dirs::cache_dir()` and every D3 variable point into C inside a session; real cache defaults
  come from `dirs::home_dir()` only.
- Report every violation, never the first only; print `report.tried` so a failing run shows
  what each probe tried.
- Keep every file under 400 lines and every function under 50 (`checks.rs` has one function
  per row above).

## Check

Once, at the end: `cargo test --test sandbox_canary` from `loom/`. In this stage the live test
prints its SKIP line ("predates the sandbox-escape-hardening policy") and passes; the four
primitive tests run for real. It builds only the library and your target, so K2's parallel
work does not affect it. The stage contracts (`the_stage_sandbox_detector_needs_every_piece_of_evidence`,
`the_require_flag_turns_the_canary_skip_into_a_failure`,
`srt_translation_grants_a_linked_worktree_its_common_dir`; scenarios in the plan YAML) must pass
against your code.
