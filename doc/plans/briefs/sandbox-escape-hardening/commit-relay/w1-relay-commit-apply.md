# W1: the `commit` relay kind and the daemon's commit

Stage `commit-relay`, wave 1, tier opus. Read `../common.md` first (decision D1 is this
stage). Line numbers were read at `3fc28031` (unchanged at `2908339a`); the plan runs after
PLAN-stage-exits-and-environment merges, so locate every edit by symbol.

## Why

Decision D1 puts the whole git common directory in every worktree session's `denyWrite`, so
`git add` and `git commit` fail in a stage worktree with EROFS. The session instead asks the
daemon to commit: `loom commit` (W2) writes a relay ticket of a new control kind `commit`, the
relay hook moves it into `W/inbox/<session-id>/`, and the daemon's inbox drain applies it at most
once. You build the protocol type, the matrix column, the one path validator both sides share,
and the daemon's apply. This is the security core of the stage: the daemon runs git on the host,
outside every sandbox, on a request the agent wrote.

## Files you own

- `loom/src/relay/kind.rs`, `loom/src/relay/matrix.rs`, `loom/src/relay/tests_matrix.rs`,
  `loom/src/relay/payload.rs`, `loom/src/relay/mod.rs`, `loom/src/relay/commit_paths.rs` (new)
- `loom/src/orchestrator/core/inbox_drain.rs` (module root: one `mod` line each for the new files)
- `loom/src/orchestrator/core/inbox_drain/apply.rs`
- `loom/src/orchestrator/core/inbox_drain/commit.rs`, `commit_read.rs`, `commit_tests.rs` and
  `commit_tests_files.rs` in the same directory (all new)
- `loom/src/orchestrator/core/inbox_drain/test_support.rs`,
  `loom/src/orchestrator/core/inbox_drain/tests_matrix.rs`
- `loom/src/commands/hook/relay/tests.rs`, `loom/src/commands/hook/relay/tests_sweep.rs`

`inbox_drain/sweep.rs` and `inbox_drain/tests_sweep.rs` belong to stage `capsule-policy`: never
touch them. `loom/src/git/**` (including `git/worktree/pinned.rs`) belongs to
`host-git-integrity`: use `WorktreeGit` read-only; if you need more from it, write it in your own
file on top of `WorktreeGit::run`.

W2 (CLI, wave 2) calls `CommitRequest` and `check_commit_request`; pin those signatures exactly
as below.

## 1. The kind (`relay/kind.rs`)

- Add `Commit` as the LAST variant of `RequestKind` (wire name `commit`, `wire_name` arm).
- `all()` returns `[RequestKind; 10]` with `Commit` last; update the doc comment ("All ten kinds
  ... then `commit` from sandbox-escape-hardening D1") and the module doc ("The ten request
  kinds").
- `is_control()` includes `Commit`; its doc says "The eight kinds only a session's lead process
  may relay".
- Test `is_control_matches_the_seven_control_kinds`: rename it
  `is_control_matches_the_control_kinds` and add `RequestKind::Commit,` as the last element of
  the expected vec. Add no other change to that assertion. Add
  `commit_is_kebab_case_on_the_wire` beside the other wire-name tests.

Every exhaustive `match` on `RequestKind` or `RequestPayload` in the crate breaks when the variant
lands. At `3fc28031` they are: `relay/kind.rs::wire_name`, `relay/payload.rs::decode_payload`,
`inbox_drain/apply.rs::apply`, `inbox_drain/test_support.rs::payload_for`,
`inbox_drain/tests_matrix.rs::classify_applied`. Confirm with
`rg -n 'RequestKind::FileDispute|RequestPayload::FileDispute' loom/src loom/tests` and report any
other hit (it is in a file you do not own).

## 2. The matrix (`relay/matrix.rs`, `relay/tests_matrix.rs`)

Append six rows to `MATRIX`: `(Stage, Commit, Apply)`, and `Refuse` for Knowledge, Merge,
BaseConflict, Adjudication and Contract. Extend the `MATRIX` doc comment: "`commit`
(sandbox-escape-hardening D1) is a `Stage` session's alone: checkout sessions keep git, and a
contract session never commits." A Contract session is worktree-rooted but its signal says "Do
not commit" (`orchestrator/signals/contract.rs:242`).

In `tests_matrix.rs` leave `EXPECTED` and `matches_the_full_six_by_nine_writer_matrix` exactly
as they are (its `assert_eq!(EXPECTED.len(), 54, ...)` line must not change). Add
`commit_is_relayed_only_by_a_stage_session`: its own independently transcribed six-row table
for the commit column, checked with `verdict`.

## 3. The payload (`relay/payload.rs`, `relay/mod.rs`)

```rust
/// `{message, paths}` for a `commit` request: the commit message and the
/// worktree-relative, `/`-separated paths to stage and commit. The daemon
/// validates both again (`relay::check_commit_request`).
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, serde::Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]
pub struct CommitRequest {
    pub message: String,
    pub paths: Vec<String>,
}
```

`RequestPayload::Commit(CommitRequest)`; `decode_payload` arm
`RequestKind::Commit => Ok(RequestPayload::Commit(decode(payload, "commit")?))`. Export
`CommitRequest` from `relay/mod.rs` beside `HandoffRequest`. Inline test
`decodes_a_commit_request_and_refuses_an_unknown_field`.

## 4. The shared validator (`relay/commit_paths.rs`, new)

Declared `mod commit_paths;` in `relay/mod.rs`, re-exported:
`pub use commit_paths::{check_commit_request, MAX_COMMIT_MESSAGE_BYTES, MAX_COMMIT_PATHS, MAX_COMMIT_PATH_BYTES};`

```rust
pub const MAX_COMMIT_PATHS: usize = 256;
pub const MAX_COMMIT_PATH_BYTES: usize = 1024;
pub const MAX_COMMIT_MESSAGE_BYTES: usize = 8 * 1024;

/// Every rule a commit request must meet before git runs: a message, and
/// paths that are normalized, relative, inside `worktree`, outside loom's
/// state and the session's tool configuration, and reached through no
/// symlinked directory. `worktree` is the canonical worktree root. The
/// error names the first path (or the message) that failed and why.
pub fn check_commit_request(request: &CommitRequest, worktree: &Path) -> Result<(), String>
```

Rules, in this order:

1. Message: not empty after `trim`, at most `MAX_COMMIT_MESSAGE_BYTES`, no NUL (an argv cannot
   carry one).
2. Paths: 1 to `MAX_COMMIT_PATHS` of them.
3. Each path, lexically: not empty; at most `MAX_COMMIT_PATH_BYTES`; no NUL; not starting with
   `/`; split on `/`, no empty component (so no `//`, no leading or trailing `/`), no `.` and no
   `..` component. Refusal: `path '<p>' is not a normalized path inside the worktree`.
4. Control roots: the first component is none of `.loom`, `.claude`, `.git`, `.worktrees`,
   `.work` (the legacy state link `git-add-guard.sh` also refuses), `.mcp.json`; and no
   component anywhere is `.git`. Refusal: `path '<p>' names loom state or tool configuration
   ('<component>')`. None of these is tracked in this repository (`git ls-files .loom .claude
   .mcp.json .worktrees .work` is empty at HEAD).
5. Symlinks: for each proper prefix of the path (`a`, `a/b` for `a/b/c`), `symlink_metadata` of
   `worktree.join(prefix)`: a symlink refuses with `path '<p>' goes through a symlink at
   '<prefix>'` (the phrase `through a symlink` is pinned by a contract); `NotFound` stops the walk
   (a deleted directory is a legitimate deletion, git reports anything else); another I/O error
   refuses naming it. The leaf itself may be a symlink: it is committed as a link (mode 120000),
   never followed.

Rule 5 is a by-name check, so it cannot be race-free: an agent can swap a component between the
check and any later open. It gives the CLI (W2) early feedback and the daemon a first filter. The
daemon's authority is the descriptor walk in section 5, which re-checks every component through
`openat(..., O_NOFOLLOW)` and never hands a path to git.

Inline tests (a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` at the end of the file, TempDir paths only):
`a_normalized_relative_path_passes`, `dot_dotdot_empty_and_absolute_paths_are_refused`,
`control_roots_and_nested_git_dirs_are_refused`, `a_symlinked_parent_is_refused`,
`a_symlink_leaf_and_a_missing_parent_pass`, `an_empty_or_oversized_message_is_refused`,
`too_many_paths_are_refused`.

## 5. The daemon's commit (`inbox_drain/commit.rs`, `inbox_drain/commit_read.rs`, new)

Declare `mod commit;` and `mod commit_read;` in `inbox_drain.rs` beside `mod merge_resolved;`,
and the tests beside `#[cfg(test)] mod tests_merge;` as `#[cfg(test)] mod commit_tests;` and
`#[cfg(test)] mod commit_tests_files;`.

**The threat this design answers (security review, settled).** The daemon runs git on the host,
outside every sandbox, on paths the agent names. `git add` lstat()s a file and then open()s it
without `O_NOFOLLOW`, so an agent looping `rename(file, symlink to ~/.config/gh/hosts.yml)` can
make the daemon read a credential the sandbox hides and commit it; a FIFO or a huge sparse file
stalls the poll tick. `git add -- sub` on a nested repository makes a mode-160000 gitlink, and
later host-side `git status` recurses into `sub/.git` and runs the agent's filter. So the daemon
never runs `git add`, `git commit`, `git status` or any git command that reads the worktree. It
reads each file itself through a descriptor walk and hands git only blob contents and index
entries.

```rust
/// Where a relayed commit is made: the daemon's own state and repository, the
/// stage the entry is attributed to, and the requesting session's record.
pub(super) struct CommitSite<'a> {
    pub work_dir: &'a Path,
    pub repo_root: &'a Path,
    pub stage_id: &'a str,
    pub record: &'a Session,
}

/// Make the commit `request` asks for, or say why not. Never `Err`: every
/// failure is a refusal the ledger records.
pub(super) fn apply_commit(site: &CommitSite<'_>, request: &CommitRequest) -> Settle
```

Steps (each helper under 50 lines; the file under 400):

1. **Owner and state.** Change `apply.rs::require_owner` to `pub(super)` and to return the loaded
   `Stage` (`Result<Stage, String>`); `stage_request` keeps ignoring the value. On top of it,
   refuse unless `stage.status == StageStatus::Executing` ("stage '<id>' is <status>; a commit is
   made only while it is Executing") and `stage.worktree` is `Some`.
2. **The worktree comes from the stage record, never the payload:**
   `crate::git::worktree::get_worktree_path(worktree_id, site.repo_root)`, then
   `WorktreeGit::pinned(site.repo_root, &path)`; an `Err` refuses ("the stage worktree is not a
   registered worktree: <error:#>"). `pinned` canonicalizes the worktree and checks it against
   `<common dir>/worktrees/*/gitdir` (`git/worktree/pinned.rs:66-79`).
3. `check_commit_request(request, repo.work_tree())` → refusal on `Err` (the lexical rules, and
   rule 5's by-name symlink check as a first filter).
4. **HEAD guard.** `symbolic-ref --quiet HEAD`: exit 0 with stdout (trimmed) equal to
   `format!("refs/heads/{}", branch_name_for_stage(stage_id))`
   (`crate::git::branch::branch_name_for_stage`, `git/branch/naming.rs:4`) passes; exit 1 is a
   detached HEAD; anything else refuses with "the stage worktree's HEAD is <x>, not
   refs/heads/loom/<id>; nothing was committed". Use the stage id for the branch, not the
   worktree id. Record `old = rev-parse --verify HEAD`.
5. **Reset the index to HEAD:** `read-tree HEAD`. Under D1 a session cannot write its git
   administrative directory, so the index is the daemon's; this drops anything an earlier
   failed request left staged. `read-tree` reads no worktree file.
6. **Read every path** (`commit_read.rs`, below) into a list of index entries (mode, blob id,
   path) and removals. Any refusal refuses the whole request; blobs already written stay as
   unreachable objects for gc. Limits: at most 256 paths (`MAX_COMMIT_PATHS`), 64 MiB per file,
   256 MiB per request.
7. **Update the index, argv only:** one `update-index --add --cacheinfo <mode>,<blob>,<path> ...`
   for every entry, then `update-index --force-remove -- <path> ...` for the removals. `--cacheinfo`
   takes the path literally (a comma in it is fine: the path is everything after the second
   comma) and reads nothing from the worktree.
8. **No gitlink:** `diff --cached --raw -z --ignore-submodules=none HEAD` (the flag overrides the
   `diff.ignoreSubmodules=all` below, which would otherwise hide a gitlink): any entry whose new
   mode is `160000` refuses. The staging above cannot create one; this is the backstop.
9. **Anything to commit?** `write-tree` gives the index's tree; equal to `rev-parse HEAD^{tree}`
   settles `Settle::Applied(Some("nothing to commit: every named path already matches HEAD".into()))`
   (a recorded result, not an error).
10. **Commit with plumbing:** `commit-tree <tree> -p <old> -m <message>` gives the new commit;
    `update-ref -m "commit (loom commit): <first line of the message>" refs/heads/loom/<id> <new> <old>`
    moves the branch only if it still points at `old` (a moved branch refuses). `git commit` is
    not used: it refreshes the index against the worktree, which reads files again.
11. **Result:** `Settle::Applied(Some(format!("committed {new}")))` with the full 40-hex id. That
    note is the ledger row's `reason`, which `loom request status` prints (W2).

On every refusal after step 5, run `read-tree HEAD` again so the index is left at HEAD.

**Every git call in the apply** goes through one helper that prepends these to the arguments
(`run_git_with_env` already adds `-c core.hooksPath=/dev/null`, `git/runner.rs:71-77`):

```rust
/// Configuration every daemon git call in a commit carries: no signing, no
/// auto-maintenance rewriting the shared git directory, no fsmonitor, and no
/// submodule recursion into a nested repository the agent planted.
const GIT_HARDENING: [&str; 14] = [
    "-c", "commit.gpgsign=false", "-c", "gc.auto=0", "-c", "maintenance.auto=false",
    "-c", "core.fsmonitor=false", "-c", "diff.ignoreSubmodules=all",
    "-c", "submodule.recurse=false", "-c", "status.submoduleSummary=false",
];
```

**`commit_read.rs`: reading a path without following anything.** Open the canonical worktree
root as a directory (`crate::fs::safe_fs::safe_open_dirfd(repo.work_tree())`, `fs/safe_fs.rs:59`;
check it opens with `O_DIRECTORY` and refuses a symlinked final component, else open it yourself
with `libc::open(..., O_RDONLY | O_DIRECTORY | O_NOFOLLOW | O_CLOEXEC)`). Then, per path:

- **Parents:** for each parent component, `openat(dirfd, name, O_RDONLY | O_DIRECTORY |
  O_NOFOLLOW | O_CLOEXEC)`. `ELOOP` or `ENOTDIR` refuses with `path '<p>' goes through a symlink
  at '<prefix>'` (race-free: the kernel refuses the link at open). `ENOENT` means the leaf is
  absent (a deleted directory). After opening each parent below the root,
  `fstatat(fd, ".git", AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW)` succeeding refuses with `path '<p>' lies inside a
  nested repository at '<prefix>'` (the root itself holds the worktree's own `.git` file; skip
  it). Mirror the `unsafe` and `OwnedFd` idioms of `fs/safe_fs.rs::portable_open_walk`; it is
  private, and `open_safely` (`safe_fs.rs:242`) opens a whole relative path at once, which does
  not give you each parent to check for `.git`.
- **Leaf:** `fstatat(parent, leaf, AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW)`:
  - regular file: `openat(parent, leaf, O_RDONLY | O_NOFOLLOW | O_NONBLOCK | O_CLOEXEC)`, then
    `fstat` on the descriptor must again say regular (a FIFO swapped in opens at once under
    `O_NONBLOCK` and fails this; a symlink swapped in fails the open with `ELOOP`; a directory
    fails the type check). Size at most 64 MiB and within the request total, checked on the
    descriptor before reading. Mode `100755` when any execute bit is set, else `100644`.
  - symlink: `readlinkat(parent, leaf)` into a 4,096-byte buffer; mode `120000`; the blob is the
    target string. Never open the target.
  - absent (`ENOENT` here or at a parent): a removal, but only if HEAD tracks the path: after
    step 5 the index is HEAD, so `ls-files -z -- :(literal)<p>` must print exactly `<p>`;
    otherwise refuse ("'<p>' does not exist and HEAD does not track it").
  - anything else (directory, FIFO, socket, device) refuses, naming the path and its type. A
    directory is refused: the CLI expands directories into files before the ticket is written.
- **Blob:** `WorktreeGit::run` takes no stdin (`git/worktree/pinned.rs:97-107`, owned by
  `host-git-integrity`), so the settled `hash-object --stdin` and `update-index --index-info`
  legs are argv-only here. Copy the bytes read from the descriptor (streamed, bounded) into a
  `tempfile::NamedTempFile` (a normal dependency, `loom/Cargo.toml:37`) created in
  `<work_dir>/commit-staging/` (create it mode 0700). No session can write the state directory,
  so git hashes exactly the bytes read through the descriptor. Then
  `hash-object -w --path=<p> <temp file>` for a regular file (`--path` applies `.gitattributes`
  conversion as `git add` would; filter drivers come only from the repository's own
  `R/.git/config`, which pinned git reads) or `hash-object -w --no-filters <temp file>` for a
  symlink's target. Delete each temp file after hashing it.

Git failure text: stderr trimmed, capped at 2,000 bytes, prefixed with the git action. Use one
helper for it; do not copy `run_git_checked`'s multi-line format.

Traps:

- `git/runner.rs::git_timeout` picks the deadline from `args.first()`: every call here starts
  with `-c`, so all get the 15 s read deadline. That is enough to hash 64 MiB and write a tree;
  accept it and say so in a comment.
- Accepted limit: the daemon's own killed git can leave `index.lock` in the worktree's git
  administrative directory. Sessions cannot write that directory, so only the daemon's git can
  leave one; the next request's `read-tree` then refuses with git's own `index.lock` message.
  Do not add lock removal.
- After a commit, the index entries added with `--cacheinfo` carry no stat data, so the next
  `git status` in the session re-hashes those files (read-only there). That is expected.
- `CommitSite` borrows: in `apply`, copy `host.repo_root().to_path_buf()` first, as the `Handoff`
  arm does (`apply.rs:69-78`).
- Keep `commit.rs` and `commit_read.rs` each under 400 lines and every function under 50. The
  literal `"add"` must not appear in either file; acceptance checks it.

## 6. Dispatch and the subagent rule (`inbox_drain/apply.rs`)

- `apply`: `RequestPayload::Commit(request) => commit::apply_commit(&CommitSite { .. }, &request)`.
- `admit`: before the matrix, refuse any control kind relayed by a subagent:
  `if inbox_entry.agent == AgentRole::Subagent && inbox_entry.kind.is_control()` →
  `Err(format!("a '{}' request from a subagent is never applied: only the session's main agent makes it", inbox_entry.kind))`.
  The relay hook already drops these (`commands/hook/relay.rs:332-344`); this is the daemon's own
  check, so a forged or future writer of `W/inbox` cannot skip it. The phrase `subagent` is pinned
  by a contract.
- Update the module doc of `apply.rs` for the new handler.

## 7. Drain fixtures and the section-5 matrix (`test_support.rs`, `tests_matrix.rs`)

- `test_support.rs`: `payload_for(RequestKind::Commit)` returns
  `json!({"message": "test(relay): commit a.txt", "paths": ["a.txt"]})`. Add
  `Fixture::commit_worktree(&self, owner: &str) -> PathBuf`: calls
  `crate::verify::contracts::test_support::contract_worktree(&self.repo_root, STAGE)` (a repo on
  `main` with the worktree `.worktrees/s1` on `loom/s1`), sets `user.name`/`user.email` in the
  repository's own config (`contract_worktree`'s commits pass identity with `-c` only, and the
  daemon's pinned git reads the repository config), writes `a.txt` in the worktree, and saves
  `STAGE` Executing, owned by `owner`, with `worktree: Some(STAGE.to_string())`. Returns the
  worktree.
- `tests_matrix.rs`: `SECTION_5` becomes `[(SessionType, [Cell; 10]); 6]` with a tenth
  (commit) column: Stage `A`, every other row `R`; update the doc line listing the order.
  `run_cell` sets up `fx.commit_worktree(&record.id)` for `Commit`; `classify_applied` checks the
  stage branch gained one commit (`git rev-list --count main..loom/s1` is `1`, through
  `crate::verify::contracts::test_support::pinned(&worktree)`); `assert_no_effect` checks it
  gained none when `kind == RequestKind::Commit`. No existing `assert` line changes.

## 8. Unit tests (`inbox_drain/commit_tests.rs`, `commit_tests_files.rs`, new)

Drive the real pass (`super::run_pass(&mut host, &fx.tick(Utc::now()))`) with
`fx.relay(&record, RequestKind::Commit, payload)`, and read results from `fx.ledger(sid)` (take
the LAST row for the id with an outcome; see the mistake quoted below) and from pinned git. Every
refusal test also asserts the stage branch did not move and the index equals HEAD
(`diff --cached --quiet` exits 0).

`commit_tests.rs`:

- `a_stage_session_commits_the_named_paths_only` (another dirty file stays uncommitted; the note
  is `committed <sha of loom/s1>`; the commit message equals the request's)
- `nothing_staged_is_recorded_as_nothing_to_commit` (Applied, not Refused)
- `a_deletion_is_committed`
- `a_path_escaping_the_worktree_is_refused_before_git_runs`
- `a_control_root_path_is_refused` (`.loom/work/x`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.mcp.json`,
  `sub/.git/config`)
- `a_head_off_the_stage_branch_is_refused` and `a_detached_head_is_refused`
- `a_stage_that_is_not_executing_is_refused`
- `a_session_that_does_not_own_the_stage_is_refused`
- `the_daemon_commit_ignores_repository_hooks_and_signing` (the repository config sets
  `core.hooksPath` to a directory holding a failing `pre-commit`, `commit.gpgsign=true` and
  `gpg.program=false`; the commit still lands)
- `a_stale_index_lock_is_reported` (an `index.lock` created in the worktree's git directory
  before the pass: Refused, the reason contains `index.lock`)
- `a_control_request_from_a_subagent_is_never_applied` (an entry with `agent: Subagent`, built
  with `entry_for` then the field changed)
- `a_replayed_commit_entry_is_applied_once` (after the first pass, change `a.txt` again, plant
  the same entry's bytes with `fx.plant`; a second pass leaves the branch head and the ledger's
  outcome rows for that id unchanged)

`commit_tests_files.rs`:

- `a_symlinked_parent_is_refused_and_nothing_is_read_through_it` (the outside file's blob, from
  `git hash-object` without `-w`, is absent from the object store)
- `a_symlink_leaf_is_committed_as_a_link` (mode `120000`, blob equal to the target string, the
  target's content absent from the object store)
- `a_fifo_is_refused_without_blocking` (`libc::mkfifo`; the pass returns, Refused naming it)
- `a_directory_path_is_refused`
- `a_path_inside_a_nested_repository_is_refused` (`sub` holds a `.git` directory whose config
  defines `filter.x.clean` touching a marker, and `sub/.gitattributes` says `* filter=x`: Refused,
  the reason contains `nested repository`, no marker, no `160000` entry)
- `an_oversized_file_is_refused_unread` (a sparse file set to 65 MiB with `File::set_len`)
- `an_executable_file_keeps_its_exec_bit` (mode `100755`)
- `a_missing_untracked_path_is_refused`
- `the_regular_leaf_open_refuses_a_symlink` (call the leaf-open helper directly on a symlink:
  `Err`, as when a regular file is swapped for a symlink between `fstatat` and `openat`)

Git in tests: `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`/`GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` at missing files and `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`
for the fixture's own git commands, as `src/verify/impact_tests_tests.rs` does.

## 9. The relay hook's Rust side (`commands/hook/relay/tests*.rs`)

No production change: `Request::admit` (`commands/hook/relay.rs:332-353`) and the sweep
(`relay/sweep.rs`, control kinds excluded) follow `is_control()`. Add, mirroring
`a_control_kind_from_a_subagent_is_refused_even_when_allowed` (`tests.rs:195-204`):

- `tests.rs`: `a_commit_ticket_from_a_subagent_is_refused` (keep the file under 400 lines).
- `tests_sweep.rs`: `a_leftover_commit_ticket_is_never_swept`.

## Maintainability

None of your files is in `loom/maintainability-baseline.txt` at `3fc28031`. Keep every file
under 400 lines and every function under 50. `apply.rs` is 324 lines today.

## Check

One run, after everything compiles: `cargo test --lib orchestrator::core::inbox_drain::`. W3 and
W4 edit other files in parallel; a compile error in a file you do not own is theirs: report it
with its file:line. Your code must satisfy the stage's contracts
`daemon-refuses-escaping-and-control-paths`, `daemon-refuses-a-symlinked-parent`,
`daemon-refuses-when-head-is-not-the-stage-branch`, `a-commit-request-applies-once`,
`a-subagent-commit-entry-is-refused`, `daemon-refuses-special-files-and-nested-repositories` and
`a-symlink-leaf-is-committed-as-a-link-never-its-target` (scenarios in the plan's YAML).
